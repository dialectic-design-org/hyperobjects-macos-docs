# [✍️] Render Pipeline

The render pipeline is where the image forms.

The algorithms forming this image can leverage the defined geometries in the scene in various ways.

The combinations of the geometries defined in the scene & render passes forms the image.

One is not more important than the other, that is a matter of perspective depending on the goal or envisioned effect.

There are multiple building blocks that can be used to form various rendering pipelines.
